                I've always had a desire for everything involving computers, graphics, designing, web etc. I've always in to the way all of these components worked together and soon found out I really loved it. Now I am here with UCF Coding Bootcamp to fulfill my goal!!
                I was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico and have lived in Orlando for 13 years!
                My favorite hobbies would have to be going to the beach as often as I can, saltwater reef aquariums, sports cars/races and I also enjoy cooking. I am a very good cook I have to say!

                    Becoming a Web Developer has always been a passion of mine and something I've always wanted to accomplish. It has been a long time goal for myself. I love creating and fixing things and to be able to create a web page and not only see its use online but also designing and managing the inner and outer workings of that webpage is what I would enjoy the most!
